          <p>
            In my career I had opportunity to create <strong>web</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>mobile applications</strong>, both <strong>client</strong>{" "}
            and <strong>server side</strong>. Ok, but how it all started? I used
            to draw a lot in my childhood - and I am doing that until now.
            Later, in high school I was{" "}
            <strong>creating building designs</strong>. There was always that
            one particle inside of me which makes me enjoy{" "}
            <strong>creating things</strong>. After high school fate wanted me
            to start study programming. Of course the first thing that caught my
            eye was <strong>web</strong> and <strong>mobile development</strong>
            . From that first weeks - even days - all I'm doing is thinking
            about what fancy application I could do, that would be nice looking
            and functional. Currently I accept various types of orders, I am
            working full time job as a programmer -{" "}
            <strong>Mobile / Frontend Developer</strong>, which allows me to
            earn a living while doing something I feel strong with, what makes
            my eyes shine. If you want to hire me or give me an assignment, so I
            can share my passion with you, <strong>fill in the form</strong> at
            the end of the website or just go into one of my social medias and{" "}
            <strong>message me</strong>.
